# Sudoku-Solver

This is a simple implenemtation of *Sudoku Solving Algorithm*. The program is given a start sudoku grid and by using a method based on imprived *Backtracking Algorithm* solves the sudoku grid. Some sudoku start configuration has more than one solution, in that case the program will output one of the solutions, and in case of no solution available for the sudoku start configuration, the program will output `This Grid Has No Solution!`.
